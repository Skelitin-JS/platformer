# (Name still wip, as is game)
Hello, this is a game 100% made in javascript. Well besides that tiny bit of HTML for the canvas but still-

I am using a youtube guide to make this project, url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2vvZn5aoo&t=225s

Website is currently a github.io site, but I plan to change that.
 
If you would like to use the code for yourself, of course thats fine. It's not my code anyways.
